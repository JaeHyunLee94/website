### Hashing based collision detections and resolutions for tetrahedral deformable bodies

This repository contains implementations of two papers:

 1. [Optimized spatial hashing for collision detection of deformable objects](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/tetraederCollision.pdf)


 2. [Consistent penetration depth estimation for deformable collision response](https://cg.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/publications/2004_VMV_penetrationDepth.pdf)

 This code is also a part of the [ACM SIGGRAPH 2021](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=ACM+SIGGRAPH+2021&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) paper titled [Constrained projective dynamics: real-time simulation of deformable objects with energy-momentum conservation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3450626.3459878?casa_token=gdWYjIfObI0AAAAA:N5L_CBJZei-5VG6OGEeh96Q_9ffWpICrTaOyqKjy5xJ1oa_JUAehzXsUcr8OKf_HeTUbu-cGV4oJ8LM)
