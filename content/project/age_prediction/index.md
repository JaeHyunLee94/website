This project is to estimate the age of various face from webcam or video streaming I didn't used Object detection model like Mask-RCNN

Dataset: [MegaAge](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/MegaAge/)

Face detection module: OpenCV Haar Cascades face detection module

I have trained my model using several model like ResNet,DenseNet and pick the best one.
