abstract: In general, it is not easy to simulate an elastic body that undergoes large defor- mations. Especially when its elements are inverted or tangled, that is, when its vertices penetrate its polygons, simulation often fails. In this paper, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for alleviating the inversion problems of elastic bodies. Our experiments made with typical optimization-based solvers demonstrate that the proposed method successfully stabilizes the solvers and produces visually plausible motions. We believe that our method can be widely adopted by a variety of state-of-the-art elastic-body simulators thanks to its simplicity.
